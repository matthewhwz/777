\textbf{Terms in the paper}&\textbf{Definition}\\
\toprule
COVID-19&Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough and fatigue.\cite{covid19def}\\
\midrule
Pandemic&(of a disease) existing in almost all of an area or in almost all of a group of people, animals, or plants\cite{pandemicdef}\\
\midrule
Tests&Test for determining the virus's occurrence in the subject, including Deep Throat Saliva Test, Combined Nasal and Throat Swabs Test, Nasopharyngeal swab Test, and Antibody Test.\cite{testsdef}\\
\midrule
Pooling test&Mixing samples together before testing and test the mixed sample in order to use less test resources\cite{pooldef}\\
\bottomrule

\textbf{Variable}&\textbf{Definition}\\
\toprule
$N$&Total number of population to be tested\\
\midrule
$n$&The group size\\

\subsection{General Assumptions and Justifications}
\begin{tabular}{p{8.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Assumption}&\textbf{Justification}\\
\toprule
The test result is 100\% accurate and there will never be a false positive or false negative result in the test&This is for the ease of the construction of the model\\
\midrule
There isn't a limit for the amount of samples tested once&This is for the ease of the construction of the model\\
\midrule
The amount of samples collected at once is enough for doing the test required&This is for the ease of the construction of the model\\
