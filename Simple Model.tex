\section{Simple model}
We start with the simplest form of this problem. With a fixed number of people waiting to be tested, when does it take fewer total tests if the samples are pooled and tested together first. Since $p$ is the infection rate , the probability of not infected will be $(1-p)$.

\subsection{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We successfully build the simplest from of our model when the group size is equal to 2, 3 and 4, considered different situations and analyzed the result.
  \item From the data calculated, we discovered some interesting patterns:
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item In ideal solution, the requirement of the infection rate $p$ increases (must be lower) as the groups size increases. The worse case solution can get the same conclusion after the group size is greater than 4.
     \item The difference of expected value of test between the ideal test and the worse case went smaller and smaller while the group size increases.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item We also discovered some disadvantages of our model: 
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item We need to calculate the expected value for every group size if we need to compare the efficiency of different group sizes.
     \item As we can only find the range of $p$, we cannot find the maximum group size for a certain inflection rate $p$ by this method easily without advanced analysis.
